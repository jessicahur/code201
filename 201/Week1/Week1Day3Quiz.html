		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p class="lastPara">Code fellows was established in 2013 in Seattle, Washington to help close a gap in the local market for software developers.  The founders of Code Fellows worked with local companies to determine what skills where in highest demand.  They developed an immersive course using a non-traditional approach to learning.  </p>

           <h1>Options</h1>
		<p class="test3">There are options for those who want to learn full time during the day and for those that can only attend night courses.  There are also scholarships available. Whatever your needs and schedules, they are working to meet your needs.  If you have been considering learning to code, but a traditional classroom schedule and methods are not a good fit for you, look into Code Fellows </p>
		<h2>PathSpec</h2>
		<p id="secondPara"> If no  is given when -A option is used, all files in the
           entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git used to limit
           the update to the current directory and its subdirectories)</p>
		<h3>Git</h3>
		<p class="thirdPara">Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to
           add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.  dir to
           add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to
           match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g.
           specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in
           the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but
           also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree. Note that
           older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use --no-all
           option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed
           ones.</p>
